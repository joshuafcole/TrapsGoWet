# [JPT] Traps Go Wet
Build traps on water without bridges in RimWorld. 

[**>>> DOWNLOAD IT HERE <<<**](https://github.com/jptrrs/TrapsGoWet/releases/latest)

_Raiders aren't afraid to dip their toes, so why you're required to build a bridge to hold your trap? Just sink them to the bottom!_

This will enable you to build any trap on any terrain.
